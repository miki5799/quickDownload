## Quick Download Location Setter - Chrome Extension
### Description:
The "Quick Download Location Setter" is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the user's downloading experience by allowing 
custom download paths based on specific domains. Instead of downloading all files to a single location, users can pre-define 
paths for specific domains, ensuring that files get saved in an organized manner without manual intervention. This extension is 
especially useful for individuals who frequently download files from various sources and want to maintain a structured directory 
system.

### Features:
Domain-Specific Paths: Easily set custom download paths for specific websites or domains.
Debug Mode: A built-in debugging feature provides feedback on the extension's internal processes, helping in troubleshooting and 
understanding its workflow.
Registry Manipulation: View, add, update, or delete domains and their associated paths directly from the extension's UI.
Intuitive User Interface: A user-friendly interface ensures that setting up and managing custom paths is a breeze.
Usage:
After installing the extension, users can access its UI to add domains and specify desired download paths. Once set, any 
downloads initiated from the specified domains will automatically be saved to the corresponding paths. The extension also offers 
a debug mode for those interested in viewing its internal operations.

### Development:
This extension was developed for personal use to streamline and organize the file downloading process. It leverages Chrome's 
Extensions API to seamlessly integrate with the browser and provide a smooth user experience.
